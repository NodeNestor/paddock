//! One port, both schemes.
//!
//! The obvious design - https on the configured port, http on another - breaks
//! every bookmark, every `--endpoint` flag and every health check the moment
//! TLS is switched on, and leaves a user who typed `http://` looking at either
//! a dead port or a screenful of binary. So instead the listener reads the
//! **first byte** of each connection before deciding anything. A TLS
//! ClientHello always begins with `0x16` (the TLS record type for `handshake`);
//! an HTTP request always begins with a method's first letter. One byte
//! separates them with no ambiguity.
//!
//! Given that, the routing rule writes itself:
//!
//! | first byte | peer | what happens |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `0x16` | anyone | TLS, then the app |
//! | else | loopback | plain HTTP, exactly as before TLS existed |
//! | else | remote | `301` to the https URL |
//!
//! The loopback row is load-bearing. The CLI reaches the manager over
//! `http://127.0.0.1`, `healthz` is polled the same way, and the Studio hands
//! runners a plain `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/mcp/artifacts` callback URL for
//! its own MCP server. All of that keeps working untouched, which is what
//! makes turning TLS on by default safe rather than a migration.
//!
//! `ROOT_PATH` is the one exception to the redirect: the root certificate has
//! to be fetchable *before* the client trusts anything, so redirecting it into
//! a warning page would be a circular argument.
