//! CUDA-graph capture without the instantiate-flag enum.
//!
//! cudarc's safe `CudaStream::end_capture` takes a `CUgraphInstantiate_flags`
//! bindgen enum whose variants are the real flag bits (1/2/4/8) - there is no
//! "no flags" variant, so every capture site used to conjure one with
//! `transmute(0)`. A zero value of that enum is not a valid value, i.e. UB;
//! debug builds trip over it inside the enum-to-word cast. What we actually
//! want is the driver call `cuGraphInstantiateWithFlags(..., 0)`, so this module
//! ends the capture at cudarc's `result` layer and passes a literal 0 flags
//! word, owning the raw graph handles itself (cudarc's `CudaGraph` cannot be
//! constructed from outside the crate).
