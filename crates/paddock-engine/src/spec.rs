/// Shortest and longest suffix lengths the drafter matches on. The floor is
/// 3: a 2-gram fallback measured precision-NEGATIVE in G3 (it fired on
/// ", " glue and proposed 473 garbage drafts with 0 accepted = a 0.6x
/// slowdown). The ladder above 3 is pure precision: any occurrence of a
/// longer suffix contains the 3-suffix at the same end position, so the
/// match SET equals 3-gram-only - only the chosen continuation improves
/// (longest matching context wins, which disambiguates template-boundary
/// grams and survives more verify rows).

/// position right after its most recent occurrence; at draft time try the
/// LONGEST suffix first and propose the tokens that followed its last prior
/// match. No match at any n -> no draft. Two positions are kept per gram
/// because the newest entry is always the current suffix itself (its
/// continuation does not exist yet). Keys are FNV-1a hashes (collisions are
/// safe: every draft is verified, a collision only costs acceptance).
/// Purely host-side: a push is six map inserts, a lookup up to six probes -
