//! The fixtures are one 0.5 s 440 Hz tone at 16 kHz mono, encoded eight ways
//! (`tests/data/audio-formats`, made with ffmpeg - see the commit that added
//! them). Half a second because MP3 and AAC prepend encoder priming and pad
//! the tail: a shorter clip and the padding is most of the file.
//!
//! What each case asserts is that we got the TONE back, not merely that the
//! decoder returned `Ok` with some samples in it. A decoder wired to the wrong
//! container, or handed the wrong channel layout, or reading the bytes at the
//! wrong stride, still returns a plausible-looking buffer - it just does not
//! contain a 440 Hz sine. A Goertzel at 440 against a control bin catches
//! every one of those; a length check catches none of them.
