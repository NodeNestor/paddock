//! Parity for `argmax_top2_rows`  - the kernel every whisper
//! decode step now ends on.
//!
//! Four properties matter, and they are different in kind:
//!
//! 1. The PICK must not MOVE. It is the same greedy token `argmax_rows`
//!    returns, ties included. If asking for confidence could change which
//!    token a transcript contains, the feature would be a correctness hazard
//!    rather than a readout - so the two kernels are run side by side on the
//!    same logits and required to agree exactly.
//!
//! 2. The numbers must be the log-softmax. Compared against a host
//!    log-sum-exp, not against a previous run of the same kernel.
//!
//! 3. The RUNNER-UP must be the SECOND-BEST, exactly. A top-2 that gets rank 1
//!    right and rank 2 wrong passes every gate the confidence readout had
//!    before this rung existed - the margin would simply be a plausible number
//!    that is not the margin. It gets its own case because of that, not
//!    because top-2 is hard.
//!
//! 4. The entropy must be the Renyi-2 of the actual distribution, including at
//!    the two ends (a peaked row reads ~0, a uniform row reads log n) - which
//!    is the property Shannon over a 51866-vocab tail gets backwards, and the
//!    reason this column exists.
//!
//! Light (no model load).
