// Speaking into the conversation  - the mic's second job.
//
// In a speech-model chat the composer is a control surface, not a sink: what
// you say belongs in the thread, not in a text box you then have to send. So
// the turn is created the moment recording starts and grows while you talk,
// one column per model, and the clip attaches when you stop.
//
// The TURN is the same ARTIFACT A DROPPED FILE PRODUCES, and that is the whole
// design rather than an implementation convenience. Since a closed utterance
// comes back with segments, word times and confidence, a live
// session can fill exactly the `TranscriptMeta` the file lane fills - so the
// player, click-a-word-to-seek, the confidence colouring, "heard differently"
// and srt/vtt export all work on it with no new renderer and no second-class
// shape. An utterance is a timed span of speech, which is what a segment is.
//
// What used to happen instead: the live text was a PREVIEW under the composer,
// and on stop the recording was sent through the file endpoint and transcribed
// a second time. You watched a transcript form and then a different one
// replaced it. That path is gone.
